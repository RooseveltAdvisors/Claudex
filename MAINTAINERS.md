# Maintainers

Claudex uses a small maintainer led model with transparent decisions in public
issues, discussions, and pull requests whenever security and privacy permit.

## Active maintainers

| Maintainer | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| [@BeamoINT](https://github.com/BeamoINT) | Repository administration, triage, review, security response, releases, and community moderation |

Maintainer status reflects active responsibility rather than ownership of
community contributions. New maintainers may be invited under the criteria in
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Triage and response targets

Claudex is volunteer maintained, so these are targets rather than service level
agreements:

- acknowledge actionable bugs and pull requests within seven days;
- ask for missing reproduction details before labeling an issue confirmed;
- route support questions to Discussions and suspected vulnerabilities to the
  private process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md);
- explain duplicate, declined, or out of scope decisions before closing;
- keep `good first issue` tasks narrow, documented, and free of hidden design
  decisions;
- add `help wanted` only when maintainers can review and support the work.

Issues that need more information may be closed after 30 days without a reply,
but can be reopened when the requested evidence is available. Confirmed bugs
are not closed solely because they are old.

## Label guide

| Label family | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `question` | Contribution type |
| `area: ...` | Primary component or maintenance surface |
| `platform: ...` | Platform specific impact |
| `good first issue`, `help wanted` | Maintainer supported contribution opportunities |
| `needs reproduction` | More evidence is required before implementation |
| `dependencies` | Automated or manual dependency maintenance |
| `breaking change` | Requires migration notes and explicit maintainer review |

Security vulnerabilities are never tracked with a public security label. Use a
private GitHub Security Advisory instead.

## Pull request and release policy

Every pull request must pass the required cross platform checks and receive
maintainer review. Sensitive changes to authentication, installers, updates,
download verification, provider routing, permissions, or release workflows
require code owner approval. Maintainers use squash merging for a readable
history and credit contributors in release notes when their work ships.

Releases are built only from annotated tags on a green `main` commit. The
release workflow verifies the exact archives before publication, and the public
website installers are tested from fresh Linux, macOS, and Windows runners
afterward. See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for the operational
release checklist.

## RooseveltAdvisors fork maintenance

RooseveltAdvisors/Claudex is a public fork of BeamoINT/Claudex. Its upstream
remote is `https://github.com/BeamoINT/Claudex.git`. To sync, fetch upstream
`main`, then merge or rebase it, resolve conflicts, and keep RooseveltAdvisors
limit defaults unless upstream has raised them higher. Fleet installations must
come from this fork; the upstream BeamoINT Homebrew tap alone is not sufficient.
